# Bot

Bot is a JavaScript conversion of a decades-old paper-and-pencil game I played
as a child.  You probably shouldn't take it too seriously.

To play, just download the code locally using your favorite method and point
your browser at index.html, or visit https://uakotaobi.github.io/bot/ to play
the online version.

A full list of credits can be found in about.html#credits.

## Sprites too small when the game starts?

This is a known problem.  Click on a bad guy or click on a weapon to resize
the sprite images.
